    <p>Little brown mouse with a typical American name is called Jerry. It is probably stupid to introduce you with the most famous cartoon characters in the world. Kids who live in the coolest parts of Alaska, or the driest part of Sahara desert, or the rain forests of Brasil, probably they all already know who Tom and Jerry were.
      To cut the long story short, Jerry is sharing food with Tom and most of the time that is a big problem for Tom. Better word instead of sharing would be stealing. Well, what can he do. People keep cats as pets mostly. They don't like mice that much.
He's just a plain houshold cat that sleeps most of the day, and when he does not sleep, he tries to eat something nice - cheese, maybe a bottle of milk. </p>
